##Payment Processing ApplicationYou can view the project live here: [http://still-reaches-4133.herokuapp.com/](http://still-reaches-4133.herokuapp.com/)To run this locally, you'll need [nodejs](nodejs.org) and [mongodb](mongodb.com) as prerequisites.###Installation Instructions:`$ git clone [link]``$ cd paymentsInNode``$ npm install`Check `app.js` to check which server connection is active. ( I keep both `localhost` and `MongoLab` setup so it can be quickly ran locally or deployed ).In a separate terminal tab run `$ mongod` to start the mongo server.`$ nodemon bin/www`( if you don't have `nodemon` use `$ node bin/www`)Navigate to localhost:3000 in your Chrome browser.##About This Project####Built With:* Node.js* Express* MongoDB* Mongoose* jQuery* Handlebars* Bootstrap* Less>Following these styleguides[JS](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/es5) and [CSS](https://github.com/airbnb/css)<br />The Send Money page validates on the client side. The data entered is also used to populate the Transaction History page.The Success page will display the information you just entered on the Send Money page.The data on the live site is persistent and hosted on MongoLab.<hr />I'm using bootstrap and jQuery, but I tried not to rely on them too much for doing things like toggling, building an accordion, and styling.
